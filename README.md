# Overview
Survival analysis of data from an experiment testing the effects of increased growing temperatures and elaiosome presence/absence on seed removal by insects.

# Files

**SRDAnalysis** *(.R)* - Script analysing and plotting the data.

**SeedRemovalData** *(.csv)* - The seed removal data, formatted as a time series. The number of remaining seeds are counted every 30 minutes for the first 12 hours, and then every 12 hours after that until 48 hours have elapsed. Each row represents one of ten replicates for each unique combination of three binary variables: warmed/unwarmed parent plants, elaiosome present/absent, and species *Carduus* *nutans*/*acanthoides*; there are thus a total of 80 replicates.

**Figure1** *(.jpeg)* - Plots of four combinations of warmed/unwarmed parent plants and species *Carduus* *nutans*/*acanthoides*, comparing seed removal between elaiosome present/absent.

**Figure2** *(.jpeg)* - Plots of four combinations of elaiosome present/absent and species *Carduus* *nutans*/*acanthoides*, comparing seed removal between warmed/unwarmed parent plants.

**AntSeedDispersalMS_v1** *(.docx)* - The manuscript for this research.
